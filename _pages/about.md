<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](http://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu), advised by Prof. [Xin (Eric) Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io). 
I received my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, where I was honored with the **Best Computer Science Research Award**. 
Prior to that, I earned my B.E. in Software Engineering from Tsinghua University and graduated with the distinction of **Outstanding Undergraduate**.

At USC, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jieyu Zhao](https://jyzhao.net) and Prof. [Kuan-Hao Huang](https://khhuang.me).

My research interests primarily lie in **multimodal learning** and **AI agents**. Recently, I have been particularly interested in improving the **fine-grained reasoning capabilities of multimodal models** and in developing **open-ended self-improving agents**.
